    "When I was at school I used to take part in Olimpiad in Informatics. I dived deep into algorythms. But I decided to study enonomics to have wider view of the world I live in. During and after college I worked as a day trader but a feeling that I need to create things came over me. That's why I started learning react and I want to get a job as a web developer. ",
